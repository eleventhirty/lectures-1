IXD302/DES310: Deliverables
===========================

__This will be an overview of the deliverables, along with a detailed breakdown of what is expected and resources to direct the students to useful content. I'll replace this copy down the line.__

Students are provided with an existing piece of content, which I have carefully developed to include a broad range of content types. Without the burden of having to generate content, they are encouraged to develop a single page web site, where the use of narrative and storytelling is brought to the fore. The content is sectioned, with various asides, maps and charts, allowing for considerable creative interpretation.

Questions? Ping me on Twitter, or pop me an email.

Deliverable 1 - Narrative Web Site (60%)
----------------------------------------

Using your prototypes as a starting point, this is your opportunity to consider how everything fits together.

Mention creativity, etc..



Deliverable 2 - Prototypes (40%)
--------------------------------

We are expecting a number of prototypes, as detailed below. For each deliverable I've supplied links to content that you might find useful to enable you to deliver what is expected.



###2A: HTML Prototype

Taking the content supplied, build an HTML prototype that demonstrates your understanding of HTML as a design element. Things to consider:

+ Sectioning Elements
+ ARIA Roles
+ Accessibility



###2B: Storyboard

Starting with paper, create a storyboard that underpins your thinking. We expect to see thought given to how your final narrative web site might be implemented.



###2C: Interaction Prototypes

Consider your readers' interactions. How are you handling transitions between states? Have you added navigation? If so, how is this handled to provide user feedback.

+ Paddy's list…
+ Donovan's CSS Animation Content



###2D: Mapping Prototypes

We expect to see a series of prototypes that demonstrate your understanding of how mapping APIs might be used.



###2E: Charting Prototypes

We expect to see a series of prototypes that demonstrate your understanding of how charting APIs might be used.
