DES310: Narrative and Storytelling
==================================

Examining how storytelling can be used to enhance content, this module considers how concepts like art direction, pacing and narrative can be used to control the flow through information. Through the creation of a piece of narrative web-based content, students are taught the dynamics of design as it unfolds like a story, across frames and over time.

This page provides an outline of our proposed lecture content, it's a skeleton, by no means comprehensive, but it should afford a sense of the narrative arc. For a more in-depth explanation of the module's intent read the [abbreviated module descriptor](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0002/01/02/narrative-and-storytelling.html).

Deliverable: In this module students are provided with an existing piece of content (which we have carefully developed to include a broad range of content types). Without the burden of having to generate content, they are encouraged to develop a single page web site, where the use of narrative and storytelling is brought to the fore. Our content is sectioned, with various asides, maps and charts, allowing for considerable creative interpretation.

###HTML Is a Design Element

We kick off the semester with a short refresher, stressing that HTML is a design element. This session is intended to ease students back into their second year, blowing off the cobwebs and reiterating what we covered in Year 1. It is particularly designed to pick up direct Year 2 entrants that might be missing core skills.


###Stories Drive Communication

Stories form the backbone of human expression and, considered carefully, underpin interactive experiences. In this lecture we explore the magic of stories and investigate the potential storytelling has when applied to design for the devices we use daily.


###Single Page Showcase

A roundup of beautifully designed single page sites, to inspire the students. If you're looking to level the big beasts, this is where you should be aiming. We'll take a series of single page stories and break them down, exploring how narrative and pacing underpin their design.


###What Is Narrative? Learning From Print

Print's not dead, far from it. It's linear (and non-linear) and there's a lot we can learn from it. In this lecture we explore the legacy of printed narratives, exploring books, magazines and other printed ephemera, where the a story forms a backbone of the experience.


###What Is Narrative? Learning From Music and Film

From Gorecki to Glass, Kurosawa to Kubrick, there's a great deal we can learn from the worlds of music and film. In this lecture we introduce the idea of structure, rhythm and cadence, and the importance of considering the spaces within content journeys.


###Group Critique

A group critique allowing peer learning, this session affords an opportunity to gather feedback on the work done to date. Expect honest opinions, expressed fairly.


###Visual Vocabulary: Flat → skeuomorphic → Flat…

Let's explore how our visual vocabularly has evolved. Once it was flat, then it became skeuomorphic (allowing the language of the real world to inform our understanding of new, emerging devices), now it's flat again. We'll explore the past and current landscape, including Google's Material Design and IBM's new IBM Design Language.


###Moving From A → B: Designing Transitions

How we move from A → B matters. Animation can play an important part in the story. Do we use a dissolve? A Magic Move? In this lecture we'll investigate transitions between states and explore Keynote as a rapid prototyping tool for designing interactions.


###The Wonderful World of Maps

Returning to the content supplied (which includes a map) we ask: Why use a static map when we can learn all about the wonderful world of APIs? We'll explore the Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap, encouraging the students to delve a little deeper and extend their skillset.


###Amplifying Data

When designing with data, we have an opportunity to amplify that data through the careful use of design. In this lecture we explore charting libraries to present complex statistics elegantly and effectively. We'll explore Chart.js and Google Charts, encouraging the students to add a new skill to their existing toolbox.


###Optimising for Performance

We're designing for everyone, regardless of their bandwidth. Let's stop lazily designing for fat broadband pipes and start thinking of those with less capable connections. Those on mobile, those travelling on limited bandwidth, those less fortunate than us in the developed world. Let's optimise, relentlessly.
