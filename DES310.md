DES310: Narrative and Storytelling
==================================

Examining how storytelling can be used to enhance content, this module considers how concepts like art direction, pacing and narrative can be used to control the flow of information. Through the creation of a piece of narrative web-based content, students are taught the dynamics of design as it unfolds like a story, across frames and over time.

This page provides an outline of our proposed lecture content, it's a skeleton, by no means comprehensive, but it should afford a sense of the narrative arc.

###Pop Quiz: HTML Is a Design Element

A short refresher, particularly designed to pick up direct Year 2 entrants lacking skills.


###Stories Drive Communication

Stories. Why they matter.


###Single Page Showcase

A roundup to inspire the students. If you're looking to level the big beasts, this is where you should be aiming.


###What Is Narrative? Learning From Print

Print's not dead, far from it. It's also linear (and non-linear). There's a lot we can learn from print.


####What Is Narrative? Learning From Music and Film

From to Gorecki to Glass, Kurosawa to Kubrick, there's a great deal we can learn from the worlds of music and film.


###Group Critique

Honest opinions, fairly shared. A group critique allowing peer learning.


###Visual Vocabulary: Flat → skeuomorphic → Flat…

How our visual vocabularly has evolved. Let's explore how. Material Design, etc.


###Moving From A → B: Designing Transitions

How we move from A → B matters. Animation can play an important part in the story. Dissolve? Magic Move? We'll explore Keynote as a rapid prototyping tool for designing interactions.


###Google Maps API

Why use a static map when we can learn all about the wonderful world of APIs?


###Chart.js

Let's jazzamatazz those charts a little and liven them up with a spot of JavaScript.


###Optimising for Performance

We're designing for everyone, regardless of their bandwidth. Let's stop lazily designing for fat broadband pipes and start thinking of those with less capable connections. Those on mobile, those travelling on limited bandwidth, those less fortunate than us in the developed world.

Let's optimise, relentlessly.


###Group Critique

Honest opinions, fairly shared. A group critique allowing peer learning.
