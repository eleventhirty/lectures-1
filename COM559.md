COM559 - Innovation and Concept
===============================

I'll be posting supporting material for COM559 here. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, I'd suggest you educate yourself. You should all be learning about version control and, by using GitHub for my supporting content, I hope to ensure you're aware of the service and its potential.

If you're new to all of this, [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com) covers everything you need to know, including advice on how to: [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git); [Create a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo); [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo); and [Be Social](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social).

Please watch this page. This will ensure you're kept up to date when the file is updated with new content (you'll be notified in your GitHub newsfeed when any changes are made). The folks at GitHub have written a short explanation on how to [Watch a Project](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social#watch-a-project) at their Be Social page, they also have a short article on [Watching Repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories). Please make yourself familiar with this.

Thank you.


Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

There will be no design lecture this week, instead George Moore will give an overview of the relationship between COM553 and COM559. The first design lecture will take place in Week 02.


Week 02 - Idea Factories
------------------------

Everything you ever wanted to know about ideas. In this week's lecture we meet James Webb Young and learn about his five stage model for generating an endless stream of ideas. I'd recommend you purchase Young's book [A Technique for Producing Ideas](http://j.mp/atechniqueforproducingideas) before the lecture. It's short and well worth reading. It has served me well for many years.

If you're feeling adventurous, I'd suggest picking up a copy of [Smashing Book 4](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4-new-perspectives/). In addition to the final chapter, 'On Creative Spirit', which echoes this week's content it offers a wealth of other content that will also cover ground suited to final year.
