COM559 - Innovation and Concept
===============================

I’ll be posting supporting material for COM559 here. If you’re unfamiliar with GitHub, I’d suggest you educate yourself. You should all be learning about version control and, by using GitHub for my supporting content, I hope to ensure you’re aware of the service and its potential.

If you’re new to all of this, [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com) covers everything you need to know, including advice on how to: [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git); [Create a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo); [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo); and [Be Social](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social).

Please watch this page. This will ensure you’re kept informed when the file is updated with new content (you’ll be notified in your GitHub News Feed when any changes are made). The folks at GitHub have written a short explanation on how to [Watch a Project](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social#watch-a-project) at their Be Social page, they also have a short article on [Watching Repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories). Please make yourself familiar with these.

Thank you.


Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

There will be no design lecture this week, instead George Moore will give an overview of the relationship between the COM553 and COM559 modules. The first design lecture will take place in Week 02.


Week 02 - Idea Factories
------------------------

We get the ball rolling with everything you ever wanted to know about ideas. In this week’s lecture we meet James Webb Young and learn about his five stage model for generating an endless stream of ideas. I’d recommend you purchase Young’s book [A Technique for Producing Ideas](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071410945/monographic-21) before the lecture. It’s short and well worth reading, it has served me well for many years.

If you’re feeling adventurous, I’d suggest picking up a copy of [Smashing Book 4](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4-new-perspectives/). In addition to the final chapter, ‘On Creative Spirit’, which echoes this week’s content, it offers a wealth of other content that will also cover ground suited to final year. Book #4 includes content on: writing maintainable, futureproof code; building lightweight responsive sites; and building adaptive, smart interfaces, all essential reading. (Full disclosure: I authored the final chapter of Smashing Book 4, ‘On Creative Spirit’.)


Week 03 - Self-Directed Study
-----------------------------

There will be no design lecture this week, instead you are asked to focus on the development of your first deliverable.


Week 04 - Paper FTW
-------------------

This week, we’ll explore paper as an integral part of the prototyping process. We’ll consider the benefits of paper as a low cost development platform, exploring how it ‘saves itself’ and enables collaboration. We’ll explore the principles of radiant thinking and mind mapping, before exploring the process of establishing a visual grammar through mood boarding, and considering the benefits of Style Tiles.

This week’s lecture is an extension of work I’ve developed for a number of conferences, including: ‘Paper Is Your Friend’, developed for [New Adventures in Web Design](http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/workshops/); and ‘Good Ideas Grow on Paper’, developed for the [Future of Web Design](https://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2012/schedule) and [Build](http://2010.buildconf.com/workshops/index.html).


Week 05 - Digital Prototyping
-----------------------------

Building on the paper prototypes of the week before, we explore the importance of digital prototypes. Considering iterative approaches to prototyping we underline the importance of documentation and commenting of code. (Along the way, we again stress the need for some form of version control when developing digital prototypes.)

We explore different approaches to establishing and refining a visual vocabulary, including highlighting Dan Mall’s excellent documentation of his design process for [Reading is Fundamental](http://rif.superfriend.ly), in particular highlighting the role of [Element Collages](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/).


Week 06 - Self-Directed Study
-----------------------------

There will be no design lecture this week, instead you are asked to focus on the development of your second deliverable.


Week 07 - What is UX?
---------------------

This week, to prepare you for your deliverables, we'll explore UX in the broadest sense. We'll then dive into more detail as the semester progresses. Additional content will be added here in due course.


Week 08 - Break
---------------

I’d encourage all students to attend [Break](http://breakconf.org) if they can afford to. Student tickets are very reasonably priced and there remain a handful left.

We have [a comprehensive line up of events](http://breakconf.org/schedule.php) during the week of Break. Conferences are a significant part of our industry. They are not only excellent opportunities to learn, but are also – importantly – excellent opportunities to meet other like-minded people. I'd strongly encourage you to attend Break if you can, certainly if you're passionate about pursuing a career in this industry.


Week 09 - User Personas
-----------------------

This week we'll be exploring both [user personas](http://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-user-persona-research/) and [design personas](http://aarronwalter.com/design-personas/). As Aarron Walter puts it: "If your website were a person, who would it be? Is it serious, buttoned-up, all business, yet trustworthy, and capable? Is it a wisecracking buddy that makes even mundane tasks fun?"

Your web site and your users need to get along (preferably becoming best of friends), we'll considering both sides of the personality equation as a part of the design process. Additional content will be added here in due course.


Week 10 - Branding
------------------

Why do we fall in love with some brands, and not with others? What motivates people to post their [unboxing photographs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/guido_b/8009006068/) to Flickr (or even YouTube)? (More importantly, what prompts them to photograph unboxings in the first place?!)

This week we'll look at what makes a [lovemark](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/157687267X/monographic-21). We'll explore fervent brand loyalty and how to create it, for brands both large and small. Additional content will be added here in due course.


Week 11 - The Craft of Words
----------------------------

The importance of words as a design element is often overlooked. Words form the backbone of the web, and used effectively can become a  powerful tool in the web designer's toolkit. Highlighting effective use of copy in a range of designs, this week we'll demonstrate how words can be used as an essential part of building a brand's ‘voice’ and improving user experience.

We'll learn how to craft copy with personality and to embrace the world of words as a critical part of your design process. This week's content will draw heavily on the two _The Craft of Words_ books I wrote for Five Simple Steps on [Macrocopy](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/the-craft-of-words) and [Microcopy](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/the-craft-of-words-microcopy). I'd recommend reading these before the lecture, you can get both for less than the price of a [Mocha Cookie Crumble Frappuccino](http://www.starbucks.co.uk/menu/beverage-list/frappuccino-blended-coffee/mocha-cookie-crumble-frappuccino-blended-beverage).


Week 12 - Pricing and Positioning
---------------------------------

Additional content will be added here in due course.
