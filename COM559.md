COM559 - Innovation and Concept
===============================

I'll be posting supporting material for COM559 here. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, I'd suggest you educate yourself. You should all be learning about version control and, by using GitHub for our supporting lecture content, we hope to ensure you're aware of it.

Please star (Paul, star it) or watch (Tim, watch it). This will ensure you're kept up to date when the file changes.


Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

This lecture will take place in Jordanstown and be introduced by George Moore. There will be no COM559 material content this week.


Week 02 - Idea Factories
------------------------

Everything you ever wanted to know about ideas. In this week's lecture we meet James Webb Young and learn about his five stage model for generating ideas. I'd recommend you purchase Young's book [A Technique for Producing Ideas](http://j.mp/atechniqueforproducingideas) before the lecture. It's short and well worth reading.
